                              I’m a staff engineer and tech lead specializing in building scalable platforms, not just
                              shipping features. At Auth0, I lead the AI Frameworks & Services team, where I’ve
                              integrated LLMs into real products, built secure gRPC pipelines with mTLS, and
                              architected SDKs that plug into our dashboard like they've always belonged.  I modernize,
                              mentor, and delete more legacy code than most people write. I’ve replatformed monoliths,
                              modernized infrastructure with Kubernetes and GCP, built design systems, and led
                              high-performing teams from interns to staff engineers. Whether it’s AI, event-driven
                              systems, or untangling legacy code, I bring a practical, forward-looking approach—and a
                              low tolerance for technical debt disguised as “just one more hack.”
